        <h3>About the Portfolio</h3>
        <p>This portfolio is intended to showcase the projects and programs that I have created while in this Visual Programming course.</p>
        <p>I have included projects ranging from polar graphs to parallax scenes. I have also included a project that I have worked on independently from my peers</p>
        <p>Through this portfolio, I hope to display the creativity and hard work that I've put into my work.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img style="width:50%; height:40%;"src= "img/IMG_3244.jpg">
        <p>My name is Anavami. I was born on June 19, 2003 in Orangeburg, SC. I love basketball and chess. I also love to code and my favorite language is Java. </p>

        <h3>Academics and Extracuriculars</h3>
        <p>I am the president of the chess club, house capain of the 4th floor, and secretary of FBLA. I am also a tutor in GSSM's ENGAGE and SPARK! outreach programs and I play on GSSM's basketball team. </p>
        <p>I was introduced to Computer Science by a mentor that I had in the 7th-10th grade. He started me off with HTML and CSS, and eventually, we moved up to python and javascript. From there, I have been experimenting with different areas of Computer Science, whether it be using C# to code unity games or even competing with a blender project that I made in the 10th grade. </p>
        <p>Since I've come to GSSM, I've taken many Computer Science courses. These courses have introduced me to new languages such as Java, Matlab, and C++. </p>

        <h3>My Path</h3>
        <p>I started my in the Orangeburg public school district and then in the 11th grade, I decided to come to GSSM. Now at GSSM, I am taking courses that feed my curiosity in subjects such as computer science, math, and art.</p>
        <p>When I go off to college, I hope to major in Computer Science and subsequently earn a masters degree.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p role="contentinfo">"Learning ePortfolios â€” These portfolios are typically created by a student as part of a course as a way to demonstrate learning and the learning process. These portfolios are often shared with other students to elicit peer feedback. Learning portfolios support the idea of formative feedback as an essential part of the learning process." --Clemson University</p>
